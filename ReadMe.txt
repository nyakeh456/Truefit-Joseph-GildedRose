
FYI: I wasn't about to complete the unit testing as you can see i was using .Net CORE Console applicaiton but i demonstration how i was going to test Data Integrity and function 
I used a little bit of Factory Pathern but focuses on SOLID principles. I 've being feeling well and i had an issue with a cretical API that i need to fix for work. Its not an excuse but i figure i should just let you know. 
I had more time i would have a prototype app or Mock it out first and include that int the project but i don't want to missed out on this great opportunity to work for such a great company.
